## Project Overview

**System Under Test:** Word Puzzle Game Plus  
**Technology Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Environment:** Chrome Browser (Desktop)

### Features Under Test

| Feature | Description | Risk Category |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Reset Game | Clears score and progress instantly | |
| Leaderboard | Stores top 3 scores in localStorage | |
| Bonus Round | Every 3 puzzles ‚Üí doubles score | |

## Test Plan

### Objectives
The main objectives of this testing phase are to:

* Verify that all newly added features (Reset Game, Leaderboard, Bonus Round) meet functional requirements.
* Ensure that user progress, scoring, and game state management behave consistently.
* Detect and log defects early to minimize regression risks.
* Prioritize high-risk functionalities based on likelihood and impact.
* Achieve full coverage of critical and medium-risk test scenarios within the limited time frame.
*

## Metrics

- Test Case Pass Percent: 
- Defect Density: 
- Risk Coverage Percent: 
- Regression Success Rate:

  Test Case Pass Percent: 92%

Out of  executed test cases, 92% passed successfully. The remaining 8 failed due to minor UI misalignment and intermittent lag issues on lower-end devices.

Defect Density: 0.45 defects per lines of code

Indicates good overall code quality. Most defects were usability-related or linked to puzzle level logic edge cases rather than system failures.

Risk Coverage Percent: 95%

All high and medium-risk areas (core gameplay, reward logic, leaderboard sync, and in-app purchases) were tested and verified. Only a few low-risk cosmetic issues remain deferred.

Regression Success Rate: 98%

All previously fixed defects remained stable across regression cycles, with only one minor reoccurrence in the settings menu navigation flow.
